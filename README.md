# Projet-Euler by ufuG
In this repository, you'll find my solutions to various Project Euler problems. Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that require more than just mathematical insights to solve. I've been tackling these problems using my own approaches and algorithms.

My goal is to continue solving these problems independently, and I aim to reach the 200th problem by 2026.

Feel free to explore the solutions and provide any feedback or suggestions for improvement.
